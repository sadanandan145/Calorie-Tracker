I want you to build a SIMPLE, RELIABLE calorie and weight tracking app for Android.

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
I am tracking my diet and weight daily.
I enter data DAY BY DAY and I do NOT want mixing of old days data.
Each day must be stored separately like a database record.

TECH STACK (choose best simple option):
- Backend: SQLite or local JSON database
- Frontend: Android (Kotlin preferred, or React Native if easier)
- Offline first (no internet required)
- Data must persist even if app is closed

CORE REQUIREMENTS:

1. DAILY ENTRY SYSTEM (VERY IMPORTANT)
- User must first select or create a DATE (YYYY-MM-DD)
- All data entered must be linked ONLY to that date
- Once saved, data for that date should not mix with other dates
- Ability to EDIT a specific date without affecting others

2. DATA FIELDS PER DAY
Each day should store:

A. Weight
- Morning weight (kg)

B. Meals (with quantities)
- Breakfast (text + grams/ml)
- Morning Snack
- Lunch
- Evening Snack
- Dinner

C. Automatic Calculations
- Calories
- Protein (g)
- Carbs (g)
- Fat (g)
- Fiber (g)

(Use a basic food nutrition lookup table stored locally.
Exact perfection not required, but consistency is mandatory.)

D. Activity
- Steps
- Walking minutes
- Strength training (yes/no + notes)

3. DAILY SUMMARY VIEW
For a selected date, show:
- Total calories
- Protein / carbs / fat / fiber
- Steps
- Weight
- Net calorie status (Deficit / Maintenance / Surplus)

4. HISTORY & TRENDS
- List of all recorded dates
- Weight trend graph
- Calories trend graph
- Average calories & protein for last 7 days

5. DATA SAFETY
- No overwriting data accidentally
- Confirm before deleting a day
- Each day is an independent record

6. UI REQUIREMENTS
- Very simple UI (no fancy design)
- Clear sections: Date → Meals → Activity → Summary
- Manual entry friendly (text + numbers)

7. EXTRA (OPTIONAL BUT NICE)
- Export data as CSV
- Backup & restore local data

IMPORTANT RULES FOR YOU (THE AI):
- Do NOT merge data between days
- Do NOT auto-carry values from previous days
- Treat each date as a separate database row
- Prioritize correctness over fancy features

DELIVERABLES:
- Working Android app
- Clear folder structure
- Explanation of database schema
- Instructions to run on Android phone (APK or emulator)

This app is for a real person doing serious long-term weight loss tracking.
Accuracy and day-wise separation matter more than anything else.
